TODO List:
     - Experiment with ajax instead of page loads.
      x - follow/unfollow button.
      x - autocomplete for searches.
     - Make pages perttier and less empty.
      x - box below users you're following with random users you aren't following.
      	  - Done, but the selection of users should be more random...
      x - Popular tags box?
  x - Update rdoc
   x - Add @ tagging of users.
      - Works, but need to validate this somehow...
